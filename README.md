Touchy Boilerplate is a starting kit for mobile web apps
---

### Feature rundown:

* HTML template with all the META tag goodies
* Animated page navigation
* Fixed header and scrollable content
* Browser history and deep linking
* CSS JS and Image embedding
* Special UI elements
* Optimized css files and js libraries
* Environment info as CSS hooks and JS data
* Geolocation helper
* Useful CSS only shapes

### Quick start

Download the files, and take a gander in `index.html`.
Browse the page with your mobile device or desktop browser - ready to make you own app now?

If you got a php server then you have to try out [TouchyPHP](http://github.com/doat/TouchyPHP)!
It lets you embed all sorts of assets into the page, thus reducing your browsers http request calls.
We got a [demo](https://github.com/doat/TouchyBP/tree/master/demo/getfile) for that.
